# Hello World

Getting started with `ratatui` is straightforward --- Add it to the project, and you are ready to
start creating beautiful TUIs.

In this section, we will build a "hello world" TUI application.

### Install `Rust`

The first step is to install Rust.

Check
[Installation section of the official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
for more information. Most people tend to use `rustup` to manage their installation.

```admonish tip
`rustup` installs The Rust Programming Language from the official release channels,
enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated.
```

`rustup` will set you up with the latest stable version of `rust` as well as `cargo`. `cargo` is
Rust's package manager, and it is what we will use to create a new project and add `ratatui` as a
dependency.

### Create a "hello world" project

To start with a new project, you can run the following:

```console
cargo new hello-world-tui
cd hello-world-tui
```

This creates a new folder called `hello-world-tui` and changes the directory to that folder.

`cargo new` will instantiate a "binary" project by default.

```sh
$ tree .
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
   └── main.rs
```

```admonish tip
It is always good idea to add a `LICENSE` and a `README.md` for your projects.
```

You can compile and execute a "binary" project by running `cargo run`:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello-world-tui v0.1.0 (/Users/USER/gitrepos/hello-world-tui)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/hello-world-tui`
Hello, world!
```

````admonish warning
By default `cargo run` compiles your program with no optimizations and with debug information.
If you want to run it in with more optimizations, you can run `cargo run --release`.

```sh
cargo run --release
   Compiling hello-world-tui v0.1.0 (/Users/USER/gitrepos/hello-world-tui)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.08s
     Running `target/release/hello-world-tui`
Hello, world!
```

For more information, check out [the `cargo` section in the official rust
book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html).
````

### Install `ratatui`

Installing `ratatui` is as easy as running the following:

```console
cargo add ratatui crossterm
```

```admonish note
`ratatui` has to be combined with a terminal backend.
You can learn more about the different terminal backends in the [how to choose a
backend](./../../how-to/choose-a-backend.md) section. For the examples in this book, we are going to use
`crossterm`.
```

Running the above command in your console will add the latest version of `ratatui` and `crossterm`
to your project.

````admonish tip
If you are interested in adding a specific version, you can run the following:

```console
cargo add ratatui --version 0.19.0
```
````

### `src/main.rs`

Open `src/main.rs` in your favorite editor, and copy paste the following code to it:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
use ratatui::{
  prelude::{CrosstermBackend, Terminal},
  widgets::Paragraph,
};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
  crossterm::terminal::enable_raw_mode()?;
  crossterm::execute!(std::io::stderr(), crossterm::terminal::EnterAlternateScreen)?;

  let mut terminal = Terminal::new(CrosstermBackend::new(std::io::stderr()))?;

  loop {
    terminal.draw(|f| {
      f.render_widget(Paragraph::new("Hello World! (press 'q' to quit)"), f.size());
    })?;

    if crossterm::event::poll(std::time::Duration::from_millis(250))? {
      if let crossterm::event::Event::Key(key) = crossterm::event::read()? {
        if key.code == crossterm::event::KeyCode::Char('q') {
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  crossterm::execute!(std::io::stderr(), crossterm::terminal::LeaveAlternateScreen)?;
  crossterm::terminal::disable_raw_mode()?;

  Ok(())
}
```

Make sure you save and exit the file! Now we are ready to run the TUI.

### Running the TUI

We can run our program with:

```
cargo run
```

You should see a TUI app with `Hello World! (press 'q' to quit)` show up in your terminal as a TUI
app.

You can press `q` to exit and go back to your terminal as it was before.

Congratulations! :tada:

You have written a "hello world" terminal user interface with `ratatui`. We will learn more about
how `ratatui` works in the next sections.

```admonish question
Can you modify the example above to exit when pressing `q` and when pressing `Q`?
```
