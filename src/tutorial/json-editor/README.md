# JSON Editor

In this tutorial, we will be creating an application that gives the user a simple interface to enter
key-value pairs, which will be converted and printed to `stdout` in json.

The purpose of this application will be to give the user an interface to create correct json,
instead of having to worry about commas and brackets themselves.

## Initialization

Go ahead and set up a new rust project with

```sh
cargo init ratatui-example-project
```

and put the following in the `Cargo.toml`:

```
{{#include ../../../ratatui-book-tutorial-project/Cargo.toml:8:}}
```

or the latest version of these libraries

## Filestructure

Now create two files inside of `src/` so it looks like this:

```
src
├── main.rs
├── ui.rs
└── app.rs
```

This follows a common approach to small applications in `ratatui`, where we have a state file, a UI
file, and the main file to tie it all together.
