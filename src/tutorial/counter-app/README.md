# Counter App

In the previous section, we built a "hello world" TUI. In this tutorial, we'll develop a simple
counter application.

For the app, we'll need a `Paragraph` to display the counter. We'll also want to increment or
decrement the counter when a key is pressed. Let's increment and decrement the counter with `j` and
`k`.
