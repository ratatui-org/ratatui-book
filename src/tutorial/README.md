# Tutorial

## [Counter App](./counter-app/README.md)

This tutorial will set up the basics of a `ratatui` project by building a app that displays a
counter.

## [JSON Editor](./json-editor/README.md)

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Rust project and organizing its structure for a
`ratatui`-based application to edit json key value pairs. JSON Editor TUI will provide an interface
for users to input key-value pairs, which are then converted into correct JSON format and printed to
stdout.
