# Mouse Capture

Mouse capture is a mode where the terminal captures mouse events such as clicks, scrolls, and
movement, and sends them to the application as special sequences or events. This enables the
application to handle and respond to mouse actions, providing a more interactive and graphical user
experience within the terminal. It’s particularly useful for applications like terminal-based games,
text editors, or other programs that require more direct interaction from the user.

Each backend handles mouse capture differently, with variations in the types of events that can be
captured and how they are represented. As such, the behavior may vary depending on the backend being
used, and developers should consult the specific backend’s documentation to understand how it
implements mouse capture.
