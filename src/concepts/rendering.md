# Rendering

[Stub article]

Ratatui is different from GUI frameworks you might use, because it only updates when you tell it to.
Only calling `<Backend>.draw()` will actually output anything to the screen. This is important to
understand because what it means is _you_, the programmer, are responsible for keeping the TUI
responsive. If you accidentally block the thread that updates the UI, it will not update until the
thread unblocks.
