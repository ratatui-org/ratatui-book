## Awesome Ratatui ü¶Ä

We created an awesome list for curating the awesome applications/libraries built with `ratatui`!

See: <https://github.com/ratatui-org/awesome-ratatui>

If you have something built with/for Ratatui, feel free to
[add it to this list](https://github.com/ratatui-org/awesome-ratatui/blob/main/contributing.md)!

---

## Ratatui Templates üìù

We gathered the available `ratatui` templates under a single repository:
<https://github.com/ratatui-org/templates>

Currently, we have two templates:

- Simple: A template for bootstrapping a simple `ratatui` application quickly.
- Async: A more advanced template which uses crates such as `tokio` and `tracing` for creating an
  async `ratatui` application.

They can be used with [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate) as
follows:

```bash
cargo generate ratatui-org/ratatui-template
```

This repository is still under construction so feel free to take a look and help us out.
Additionally, we really appreciate if you have another template and interested in contributing it.

---

## New/Updated Examples üÜï

We added a new example
([`ratatui-logo`](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/ratatui-logo.rs)) which
shows how to render a big text using half blocks.

![ratatui-logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/ac2cf8e6b886322620e49176d37f0fdbac03483e/examples/ratatui-logo.gif)

We also updated the
[`colors_rgb`](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/colors_rgb.rs) example to
add animation and a FPS counter.

## List: Better Construction ‚ú®

`List::new` now accepts `IntoIterator<Item = Into<ListItem>>` which means you can build a `List`
like following:

```rust
List::new(["Item 1", "Item 2"])
```

However, this change will throw a compilation error for `IntoIterator`s with an indeterminate item
(e.g. empty vectors):

```rust
let list = List::new(vec![]);

// instead, this should be:
let list = List::default();
```

---

## List: Line Alignment üìè

The `List` widget now respects the alignment of `Line`s and renders them as expected.

For example:

```rust
let items = [
    Line::from("Left").alignment(Alignment::Left),
    Line::from("Center").alignment(Alignment::Center),
    Line::from("Right").alignment(Alignment::Right),
]
```

Will result in a list:

```
Left
  Center
     Right
```

---

## List: `start_corner` -> `direction`

The previous name `start_corner` did not communicate clearly the intent of the method.

A new method `List::direction` and a new enum `ListDirection` were added.

`List::start_corner` is now deprecated.

---

## Layout: Better Construction ‚ú®

We added a convenience function to create a layout with a direction and a list of constraints which
are the most common parameters that would be generally configured using the builder pattern.

```rust
let layout = Layout::new(Direction::Horizontal, [
  Constraint::Percentage(50),
  Constraint::Percentage(50),
]);
```

The constraints can be passed in as any iterator of constraints.

---

## Layout: Allow Configuring Fill üñåÔ∏è

The layout split will generally fill the remaining area when `split()` is called.

With this feature, we now allow the caller to configure how any extra space is allocated to the
`Rect`s. This is useful for cases where the caller wants to have a fixed size for one of the
`Rect`s, and have the other `Rect`s fill the remaining space.

To use this feature, add `unstable` or `unstable-segment-size` feature flag to `Cargo.toml`. The
reason for this is that the exact name for the types is still being bikeshedded.

The default behavior is `SegmentSize::LastTakesRemainder`, which gives the last segment the
remaining space.

```rust
Layout::new(
    Direction::Horizontal,
    [Constraint::Percentage(50), Constraint::Percentage(25)],
)
.split(frame.size());
```

![SegmentSize::LastTakesRemainder](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui-website/assets/36198422/ef0f8c1c-c931-4ed9-b5a2-2ce6333285af)

`SegmentSize::None` will disable this behavior.

```rust
Layout::new(
    Direction::Horizontal,
    [Constraint::Percentage(50), Constraint::Percentage(25)],
)
.segment_size(layout::SegmentSize::None)
.split(frame.size());
```

![SegmentSize::None](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui-website/assets/36198422/90b15c04-8a50-4f6e-98af-58b257575b90)

To configure the layout to fill the remaining space evenly, use
`Layout::segment_size(SegmentSize::EvenDistribution)`.

See the documentation for `Layout::segment_size()` and `layout::SegmentSize` for more information.

---

## Table: Segment Size üóÉÔ∏è

Similarly to the previous entry, this works just like `Layout::segment_size` but for tables:

```rust
let widths = [Constraint::Min(10), Constraint::Min(10), Constraint::Min(10)];
let table = Table::new([])
    .widths(widths)
    .segment_size(SegmentSize::LastTakesRemainder);
```

It controls how to distribute extra space to an underconstrained table. The default, legacy behavior
is to leave the extra space unused.

The new options are `LastTakesRemainder` which gets all space to the rightmost column that can used
it, and `EvenDistribution` which divides it amongst all columns.

---

## Table: Width Improvements ‚ú®

### `Table::new()` now requires specifying the widths of the columns

Previously, `Table`s could be constructed without widths. In almost all cases this is an error so we
made the `widths` parameter mandatory.

Which means you need to update your existing code to:

```diff
- Table::new(rows).widths(widths)
+ Table::new(rows, widths)
```

For ease of automated replacement, in cases where the amount of code broken by this change is large
or complex, it may be convenient to replace `Table::new` with `Table::default().rows`:

```diff
- Table::new(rows).block(block).widths(widths);
+ Table::default().rows(rows).block(block).widths(widths)
```

### `Table::widths()` now accepts `AsRef<[Constraint]>`

This allows passing an array, slice or Vec of constraints, which is more ergonomic than requiring
this to always be a slice.

```rust
Table::default().widths([Constraint::Length(5), Constraint::Length(5)]);
Table::default().widths(&[Constraint::Length(5), Constraint::Length(5)]);

// widths could also be computed at runtime
let widths = vec![Constraint::Length(5), Constraint::Length(5)];
Table::default().widths(widths.clone());
Table::default().widths(&widths);
```

---

## Constraint Helpers üÜò

We added helper methods that convert from iterators of `u16` values to the specific `Constraint`
type.

This makes it easy to create constraints like:

```rust
// a fixed layout
let constraints = Constraint::from_lengths([10, 20, 10]);

// a centered layout
let constraints = Constraint::from_ratios([(1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4)]);
let constraints = Constraint::from_percentages([25, 50, 25]);

// a centered layout with a minimum size
let constraints = Constraint::from_mins([0, 100, 0]);

// a sidebar / main layout with maximum sizes
let constraints = Constraint::from_maxes([30, 200]);
```

---

## Paragraph: `line_count` & `line_width` üìè

We now have a new unstable feature which helps getting information about a rendered paragraph

Enable the `unstable` or `unstable-rendered-line-info` feature flag to get access to the following
methods:

- `Paragraph::line_count`: Takes a bounding width and returns the number of lines necessary to
  display the full paragraph when rendered. The motivation for this method is to use it with
  scrollbars. If a paragraph has wrapped text, it is currently impossible to get the number of lines
  it will need.
- `Paragraph::line_width`: Returns the smallest line width needed to fully display every line of a
  paragraph. This is simply the maximum line widths.

Together, these two methods can be used to calculate the minimum bounding box for a paragraph.
Please note that they are experimental and may change in the future.

---

## Rect: `offset` üìê

Rect has a new method called `offset` and it can be used to create a new Rect that is moved by the
amount specified in the x and y direction. These values can be positive or negative. This is useful
for manual layout tasks.

```rust
let rect = area.offset(Offset { x: 10, y -10 });
```

---

## `IntoIterator` for Constraints üîÑ

`Layout` and `Table` now accept `IntoIterator` for constraints with an Item that is
`AsRef<Constraint>`.

This allows pretty much any collection of constraints to be passed to the layout functions including
arrays, vectors, slices, and iterators (without having to call collect() on them).

```rust
let layout = Layout::default().constraints([Constraint::Min(0)]);
let layout = Layout::default().constraints(&[Constraint::Min(0)]);
let layout = Layout::default().constraints(vec![Constraint::Min(0)]);
let layout = Layout::default().constraints([Constraint::Min(0)].iter().filter(|_| true));
let layout = Layout::default().constraints([1,2,3].iter().map(|&c| Constraint::Length(c)));
```

---

## Chart: Legend Position üìä

`Chart` has a new setter method called `legend_position`:

```rust
let chart: Chart = Chart::new(vec![])
    .legend_position(Some(LegendPosition::TopLeft));
```

See `Chart::LegendPosition` for other possible values.

---

## Default Highlight Style üé®

Previously the default `highlight_style` was set to `Style::default()`, which meant that the
highlight style was the same as the normal style.

This means that for example a `Tabs` widget in the default configuration would not show any
indication of the selected tab.

Now we set the `highlight_style` to the reversed style (`Style::new().reversed()`) as default.

---

## Tab: Custom Padding üìá

The Tab widget now contains `padding_left` and `padding_right` properties.

Those values can be set with functions `padding_left()`, `padding_right()`, and `padding()` which
all accept `Into<Line>`.

For convenience, you can also use the `padding` method to set left/right padding accordingly:

```rust
// A space on either side of the tabs.
let tabs = Tabs::new(vec!["Tab 1", "Tab 2"]).padding(" ", " ");

/// Nothing on either side of the tabs.
let tabs = Tabs::new(vec!["Tab 1", "Tab 2"]).padding("", "");
```

---

## Deprecate `Cell::symbol` üö´

The `Cell::symbol` field is now accessible via a getter method (`symbol()`). This will allow us to
make future changes to the Cell internals such as replacing `String` with `compact_str`.

```diff
- cell.symbol
+ cell.symbol()
```

---

## Remove Deprecated Items üíÄ

We removed `Axis::title_style` and `Buffer::set_background` which were deprecated since `0.10`.

---
