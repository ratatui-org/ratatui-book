<https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/releases/tag/v0.27.0>

‚ö†Ô∏è See the [breaking changes](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/main/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)
for this release.

## LineGauge: Background Styles üìä

`LineGauge::gauge_style` is now deprecated in favor of `filled_style` and `unfilled_style` methods
which makes it possible to set the foreground/background styles for different states.

```rust
let gauge = LineGauge::default()
    .filled_style(Style::default().fg(Color::Green))
    .unfilled_style(Style::default().fg(Color::White))
    .ratio(0.43);
```

We also added a
[Line Gauge example](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/main/examples/line_gauge.rs):

## List: Navigation Methods üß≠

You can now navigate in the `List` widget by using the following methods!

```rust
let mut state = ListState::default();
state.select_first();
state.select_next();
state.select_previous();
state.select_last();
```

It also clamps the selected index to the bounds of the list when navigating.

---

## Text: Conversion From Display üîÑ

`Text`, `Span` and `Line` now supports conversion from any type that implements the `Display` trait!

```rust
let text = "line1\nline2".to_text();
let span = (6.66).to_span();
let line = 42.to_line();
```

This has been made possible with the newly added `ToText`, `ToSpan` and `ToLine` traits
respectfully.

---

## Palette Colors üé®

‚ö†Ô∏è This is behind the "palette" feature flag.

You can now use colors from the [palette](https://crates.io/crates/palette) crate in Ratatui!

```rust
use palette::{LinSrgb, Srgb};
use ratatui::style::Color;

let color = Color::from(Srgb::new(1.0f32, 0.0, 0.0));
let color = Color::from(LinSrgb::new(1.0f32, 0.0, 0.0));
```

---

## New Border Sets üñºÔ∏è

### `border::EMPTY`

It uses an empty space symbol (‚ñë)

```rust
let block = Block::bordered().title("Title").border_set(border::EMPTY);
```

```text
‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë
‚ñë‚ñë    ‚ñë‚ñë
‚ñë‚ñë ‚ñë‚ñë ‚ñë‚ñë
‚ñë‚ñë ‚ñë‚ñë ‚ñë‚ñë
‚ñë‚ñë    ‚ñë‚ñë
‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë
```

This is useful for when you need to allocate space for the border and apply the border style to a
block without actually drawing a border. This makes it possible to style the entire title area or a
block rather than just the title content.

### `border::FULL`

It uses a full block symbol (‚ñà)

```rust
let block = Block::bordered().title("Title").border_set(border::FULL);
```

```text
‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
‚ñàxx‚ñà
‚ñàxx‚ñà
‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
```

## Re-export Backends üì§

`crossterm`, `termion`, and `termwiz` can now be accessed as
`ratatui::{crossterm, termion, termwiz}` respectively.

This makes it possible to just add the Ratatui crate as a dependency and use the backend of choice
without having to add the backend crates as dependencies.

To update existing code, replace all instances of `crossterm::` with `ratatui::crossterm::`,
`termion::` with `ratatui::termion::`, and `termwiz::` with `ratatui::termwiz::`.

Example for `crossterm`:

```diff
-use crossterm::event::{Event, KeyCode, KeyEvent, KeyEventKind};
+use ratatui::crossterm::event::{Event, KeyCode, KeyEvent, KeyEventKind};
```

And then you can remove `crossterm` from `Cargo.toml`!

---

## Update Prelude üìú

Based on a [suggestion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1cle18j/comment/l2uuuh7/)
we made changes to the `prelude` module.

> Note: This module allows you to easily use `ratatui` without a huge amount of imports! e.g.
> `use ratatui::prelude::*;`

The following items have been removed from the prelude:

- `style::Styled` - this trait is useful for widgets that want to support the Stylize trait, but it
  adds complexity as widgets have two `style` methods and a `set_style` method.
- `symbols::Marker` - this item is used by code that needs to draw to the `Canvas` widget, but it's
  not a common item that would be used by most users of the library.
- `terminal::{CompletedFrame, TerminalOptions, Viewport}` - these items are rarely used by code that
  needs to interact with the terminal, and they're generally only ever used once in any app.

The following items have been added to the prelude:

- `layout::{Position, Size}` - these items are used by code that needs to interact with the layout
  system. These are newer items that were added in the last few releases, which should be used more
  liberally.

## Tracing Example üîç

Wondering how to debug TUI apps? Tried `println` and it didn't work? We got you covered!

We added an example that demonstrates how to log to a file:

![tracing example](https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-21jgJCedh2YnFDONw0JW7l.gif)

- Code: <https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/main/examples/tracing.rs>
- Related discussion on Ratatui Forum:
  <https://forum.ratatui.rs/t/how-do-you-println-debug-your-tui-programs/66>

## Hyperlink Example üîó

We added a proof-of-concept example for using hyperlinks in the terminal.

![Demo](https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-2c5cvJzN7KTKR7U3Jbk71J.gif)

> The code is available
> [here](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/main/examples/hyperlink.rs).

---

## Cell: New methods üîß

You can now create empty `Cell`s like this:

```rust
let mut cell = Cell::EMPTY;
assert_eq!(cell.symbol(), " ");
```

We also added a constant `Cell:new` method for simplify the construction as follows:

```diff
-let mut cell = Cell::default();
-cell.set_symbol("a");
+let cell = Cell::new("a");
```

---

## Make `Stylize::bg()` generic üîÑ

Previously, `Stylize::bg()` accepted `Color` but now accepts `Into<Color>`. This allows more
flexible types from calling scopes, though it can break some type inference in the calling scope.

```rust
let srgb_color: Srgb<u8> = Srgb::new(255, 0, 0);
foo.bg(srgb_color);
```

---

## Writer Methods on Backends üñãÔ∏è

`crossterm` and `termion` backends now have `writer()` and `writer_mut()` methods for obtain access
to the underlying writer.

This is useful e.g. if you want to see what has been written so far.

```rust
let terminal = Terminal::new(CrosstermBackend::new(Vec::<u8>::new()));
let ui = |frame| { ... };

terminal.draw(ui);

let crossterm_backend = terminal.backend();
let buffer = crossterm_backend.writer();
```

---

## Add Missing VHS Tapes üìº

We were missing demos for some of our examples. They are now added!

[Constraint explorer example](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/main/examples/constraint-explorer.rs):

![constraint-explorer](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/assets/381361/9933df57-3afc-4d5b-88bd-15909f6dcdaf)

## List: Remove deprecated `start_corner()` üö´

`List::start_corner` was deprecated back in v0.25.

Use `List::direction` and `ListDirection` instead:

```diff
- list.start_corner(Corner::TopLeft);
- list.start_corner(Corner::TopRight);
// This is not an error, BottomRight rendered top to bottom previously
- list.start_corner(Corner::BottomRight);
// all becomes
+ list.direction(ListDirection::TopToBottom);
```

```diff
- list.start_corner(Corner::BottomLeft);
// becomes
+ list.direction(ListDirection::BottomToTop);
```

`layout::Corner` is also removed entirely.

---

## Padding: Deprecate `zero()` üö´

It is now a constant!

```diff
-Padding::zero()
+Padding::ZERO
```

---

## Buffer: Improve Performance ‚ö°Ô∏è

`Buffer::filled` now moves the cell instead of taking a reference:

```diff
-Buffer::filled(area, &Cell::new("X"));
+Buffer::filled(area, Cell::new("X"));
```

---

## Rect: Improve Performance ‚ö°Ô∏è

`Margin` needs to be passed without reference now:

```diff
-let area = area.inner(&Margin {
+let area = area.inner(Margin {
     vertical: 0,
     horizontal: 2,
 });
```

---

  ([#1162](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/pull/1162))
- Remove newlines when converting strings to `Line`s
  ([#1191](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/pull/1191))
  - `Line::from("a\nb")` now returns a `Line` with two `Span`s instead of one
- Ensure that zero-width characters are rendered correctly
  ([#1165](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/pull/1165))
- Respect area width while rendering &str and String
  ([#1177](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/pull/1177))
- Improve benchmark consistency ([#1126](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/pull/1126))
