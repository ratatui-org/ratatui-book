- [Hello World](./hello-world/): This tutorial takes you through the basics of creating a simple
  Ratatui application that displays "Hello World".
- [Counter App](./counter-app/): This tutorial will set up the basics of a `ratatui` project by
  building a app that displays a counter.
- [JSON Editor](./json-editor/): This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Rust project and
  organizing its structure for a `ratatui`-based application to edit json key value pairs. JSON
  Editor TUI will provide an interface for users to input key-value pairs, which are then converted
  into correct JSON format and printed to stdout.

:::note

If you want to jump right into coding yourself, we provide templates for that. See the
[template section](/templates).  
We also have some [examples](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/tree/main/examples) that might
help you get started on GitHub.
