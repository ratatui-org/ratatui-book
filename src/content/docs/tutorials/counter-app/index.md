The previous [hello world] tutorial introduced how to create a simple TUI that displayed some text and
waited for the user to press a key. This tutorial will cover how to handle state and some more complex
interactions. You will build a counter application that allows the user to increment and decrement a
value on the screen.

When you're finished the application will look like the following:

The application will render the counter in a [`Paragraph`] widget. When the user presses the left
and right arrow keys, the application will increment and decrement the value of the counter.
