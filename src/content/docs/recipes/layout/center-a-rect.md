You can use a `Vertical` layout followed by a `Horizontal` layout to get a centered `Rect`.

```rust title=layout.rs collapse={1-13}
{{ #include @code/recipes/src/layout.rs:center }}
```

Then you can use this method to draw any widget centered on the containing area.

```rust
{{ #include @code/recipes/src/layout.rs:render }}
```

A common use case for this feature is to create a popup style dialog block. For this, typically,
you'll want to `Clear` the popup area before rendering your content to it. The following is an
example of how you might do that:

```rust
{{ #include @code/recipes/src/layout.rs:render_popup }}
```

:::note

There is no method for vertically aligning text within an area yet. We recommend prewrap the text
using the [textwrap crate] and then use the line count to work out where to render the text.
