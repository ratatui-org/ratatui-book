title: Component Architecture
---

If you are interested in a more object oriented approach to organizing TUIs, you can use a
`Component` based approach.

A couple of projects in the wild use this approach

- <https://github.com/TaKO8Ki/gobang>
- <https://github.com/nomadiz/edma>

We also have a `ratatui-async-template` that has an example of this `Component` based approach:

- <https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui-async-template>

We already covered [TEA](../the-elm-architecture/) in the previous section. The `Component`
architecture takes a slightly more object oriented trait based approach.

Each component encapsulates its own state, event handlers, and rendering logic.

1. Component Initialization (`init`) - This is where a component can set up any initial state or
   resources it needs. Itâ€™s a separate process from handling events or rendering.

2. Event Handling (`handle_events`, `handle_key_events`, `handle_mouse_events`) - Each component has
   its own event handlers. This allows for a finer-grained approach to event handling, with each
   component only dealing with the events it's interested in. This contrasts with Elm's single
   update function that handles messages for the entire application.

3. State Update (`update`) - Components can have their own local state and can update it in response
   to actions. This state is private to the component, which differs from Elm's global model.

4. Rendering (`render`) - Each component defines its own rendering logic. It knows how to draw
   itself, given a rendering context. This is similar to Elm's view function but on a
   component-by-component basis.

Here's an example of the `Component` trait implementation you might use:

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use crossterm::event::{KeyEvent, MouseEvent};
use ratatui::layout::Rect;

use crate::{action::Action, event::Event, terminal::Frame};

pub trait Component {
  fn init(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
    Ok(())
  }
  fn handle_events(&mut self, event: Option<Event>) -> Action {
    match event {
      Some(Event::Quit) => Action::Quit,
      Some(Event::Tick) => Action::Tick,
      Some(Event::Key(key_event)) => self.handle_key_events(key_event),
      Some(Event::Mouse(mouse_event)) => self.handle_mouse_events(mouse_event),
      Some(Event::Resize(x, y)) => Action::Resize(x, y),
      Some(_) => Action::Noop,
      None => Action::Noop,
    }
  }
  fn handle_key_events(&mut self, key: KeyEvent) -> Action {
    Action::Noop
  }
  fn handle_mouse_events(&mut self, mouse: MouseEvent) -> Action {
    Action::Noop
  }
  fn update(&mut self, action: Action) -> Action {
    Action::Noop
  }
  fn render(&mut self, f: &mut Frame<'_>, rect: Rect);
}
```

One advantage of this approach is that it incentivizes co-locating the `handle_events`, `update` and
`render` functions on a component level.
