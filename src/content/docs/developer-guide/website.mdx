## Some Guidelines

- Prefer links from the root rather than using multiple levels of parent links. (e.g.
  `/concepts/backends/comparison/` instead of `../../backends/comparison/`).
- Prefer to add the last slash on links

## Astro and Starlight features

Starlight supports the full range of Markdown syntax in `.md` files as well as meta information for
titles and descriptions in YAML frontmatter.

See [starlight] for more information on how to author content in markdown.

## Custom components

The website uses custom components and features to make it easier to generate high quality
documentation that is more maintainable.

### Code include

Use the `remark-include-code` plugin to include code from a test file:

````markdown include=ignore
```rust
{{#include @code/hello-world-tutorial/src/main.rs:imports}}
```
````

This renders as:

```rust
{{#include @code/hello-world-tutorial/src/main.rs:imports}}
```
