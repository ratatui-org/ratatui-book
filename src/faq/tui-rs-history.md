# tui.rs history

This project was forked from [`tui-rs`](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs/) in February 2023, with
the [blessing of the original author](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs/issues/654), Florian Dehau
([@fdehau](https://github.com/fdehau)).

The original repository contains all the issues, PRs and discussion that were raised originally, and
it is useful to refer to when contributing code, documentation, or issues with Ratatui.

We imported all the PRs from the original repository and implemented many of the smaller ones and
made notes on the leftovers. These are marked as draft PRs and labelled as
[imported from tui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22imported+from+tui%22).
We have documented the current state of those PRs, and anyone is welcome to pick them up and
continue the work on them.

We have not imported all issues opened on the previous repository. For that reason, anyone wanting
to **work on or discuss** an issue will have to follow the following workflow:

- Recreate the issue
- Start by referencing the **original issue**:
  `Referencing issue #[<issue number>](<original issue link>)`
- Then, paste the original issues **opening** text

You can then resume the conversation by replying to the new issue you have created.
