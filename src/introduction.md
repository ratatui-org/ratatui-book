`ratatui` is based on the principle of immediate rendering with intermediate buffers. This means
that at each new frame you have to build all widgets that are supposed to be part of the UI. In
short, the `ratatui` library handles drawing to the terminal.

It is important to note that `ratatui`:

- does _not_ handle keyboard input events
- does _not_ modify the state of your application
- does _not_ dicate how you want to structure your application

The `ratatui` crate is a library and not a framework. And the `ratatui` library provides widgets
that allows a developer to imperatively declare what the view of your application should look like,
and then allows a developer to draw those widgets efficiently to the terminal.

For these reasons, `ratatui` can be highly flexible and customizable. And while this can be
empowering, it also does put the onus on developers using `ratatui` to understand how to best
architect their applications, to tailor the experience for users as they see fit.

## Who is ratatui for?

`ratatui` is designed for developers and enthusiasts who:

- appreciate the retro aesthetic of the terminal,
- want a lightweight alternative to graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
- need applications that are to be deployed in constrained environments, like on servers with
  limited resources, and
- prefer to have full control over input and events, allowing for a more customized and tailored
  user experience.

## Who is this book for?

In this book, we will cover beginner guides to advanced patterns for developing terminal user
interfaces.

Those new to the world of TUIs will find this book a comprehensive guide, introducing the
foundational concepts and walking through common patterns of using `ratatui`. Additionally,
developers who have worked with TUIs will understand the nuances and benefits of using `ratatui`.

We hope that this book can be a journey into creating beautiful and functional terminal-based
applications.
