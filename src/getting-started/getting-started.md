# Getting Started

Getting started with ratatui is straightforward. Simply add it to the project, and you are ready to start creating beautiful TUIs! 

After installing ratatui, try running the [hello_world.rs](https://github.com/tui-rs-revival/ratatui/blob/main/examples/hello_world.rs) example, and check out [the tutorial](./tutoral/README.md).


Already looked through those, and looking for some more advanced materials? Check out the **Concepts** chapters of this book.
